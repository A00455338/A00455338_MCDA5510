This Assigment allows a user to store invalid and valid records.I have added a Exception file where all the exceptions handeled. Then all the files are passed in a method of ParseCsvFile to check whether the values are null or not. Additionaly, Email Validation and name validation are also added in this file.A method of a class WriteResults is called in this file to store all the entries in a text file Output ( Additional Date column is added in this file ).Log file is also created to store all the log errors.

ParseCsvFile.cs = Parse the csv file and validate the data and store the number of valid and invalid records.</br>
